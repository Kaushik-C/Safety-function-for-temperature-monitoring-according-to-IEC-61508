# Safety function for temperature monitoring according to IEC 61508
This repository contains the V-model reference implementation of a safety function for SIL 3 compliant temperature monitoring according to IEC 61508.

This projection has been done as part of the "Risk Determination of Computer Architectures" course dealt in MS Functional Safety Engineering course at the University of Kassel.

Special thanks to Prof. Dr.-Ing David Schepers from Hochschule Ruhr West for organizing this course and providing me the opportunity to do this project during Summer semester 2023. 

The following artifacts were developed in accordance with IEC 61508.
